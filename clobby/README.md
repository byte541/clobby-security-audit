## Architecture
- Users create a *balance account* for each market, to claim their base and quote assets.
- Users Place a bid/ask order in  the market.
- The order will sit in the orderbook. The base/quote asset gets transferred from user account to market account.
- When an opposing order gets matched, the **fill events** and the **out events** are recorded in the `market_events` account.
- The market creator continously invokes `consume_events` instruction, which increases/decreases the base amount and quote amount of the maker/taker's balance account.
- Users can invoke `settle_balance` instruction, to get the assets from their balance account to their token account.
